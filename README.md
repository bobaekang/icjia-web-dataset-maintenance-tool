## About the Tool
The WDM Tool is a Python program written by Bobae Kang (Research Analyst, Bobae.Kang@illinois.gov) and Yizi (Winnie) Huang (intern, YiziwinnieH@hotmail.com) to facilitate the process of maintaining the R&A Unit's web-published datasets. The WDM Tool provides the ICJIA R&A staff with an easy-to-use command-line interface to carrying out tasks of maintaining and updating datasets to be published online.

Please note that the scripts stored in the `/python/` subdirectory of the current repository are not sufficient to use the program and successfully carry out web dataset maintanence tasks. This is because the actual data used to generate dataset outputs are excluded from this repository for security and confidentiality concerns.

## Documentation
To learn more about the WDM Tool, visit [the documentation website](bobaekang.github.com/icjia-web-dataset-maintanence-tool). The documentation website is generated using [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/), an open-source static-site/documentation generator.

## Presentation
The presentation slides file on the WDM Tool is available in the `/presentation/` subdirectory. The presentation was given at the monthly ICJIA Research & Analysis staff meeting for August 2018.
