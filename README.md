## About the Tool
The WDM Tool is a Python program written by Bobae Kang (Research Analyst, Bobae.Kang@illinois.gov) and Yizi (Winnie) Huang (intern, YiziwinnieH@hotmail.com) to facilitate the process of maintaining the R&A Unit's web-published datasets. The WDM Tool provides the ICJIA R&A staff with an easy-to-use command-line interface to carrying out tasks of maintaining and updating datasets to be published online.

Please note that the scripts stored in `python` subdirectory of the current repository are not sufficient to use the program and successfully carry out web dataset maintanence tasks. This is because the actual data used to generate dataset outputs are excluded from this repository for security and confidentiality concerns.
